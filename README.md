📊 Python Data Cleaning & Trend Analysis Portfolio
Welcome to my data analysis repository! This project showcases my ability to handle real-world messy data using Python and transform it into meaningful business insights.

🛠️ Problem Solved
In many business scenarios, data comes with inconsistent formatting, missing values, and incorrect data types (e.g., currency symbols in numeric columns). This project automates the cleaning process to ensure data integrity for decision-making.

🚀 Technical Implementation
Advanced Data Cleaning: Using Pandas to remove duplicates, handle NaN (Missing values), and strip unwanted characters like $ from numeric fields.

Time-Series Formatting: Converting string-based dates into standard datetime objects for accurate trend analysis.

Feature Engineering: Implementing cumulative sums (cumsum) to track running totals and financial growth over time.

Statistical Visualization: * Line Graphs: To visualize salary and growth trends over time.

Pie Charts: To represent the distribution of expenses and budget allocation.

📈 Business Insights Generated
Identified the highest and lowest salary earners to optimize budget distribution.

Tracked joining trends to understand company growth phases.

Visualized percentage-based budget shares for department-level reporting.
